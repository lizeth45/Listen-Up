Listen Up

## About Listen Up ‚ùì
Listen Up is a perfect application for those who want to improve their absolute pitch!

Listen Up offers an exciting test of 7 sounds, each one belonging to a different note of the C major scale. In each test, 3 different sounds are played and the goal is to select the correct sound that corresponds to the evaluated note. But be careful! Only one of the three sounds is correct.

At the end of the test, the application will provide results on your ability to recognize the different notes.

## Frameworks üíª
In my project I used SwiftUI to design my interfaces and AVKit to playing sounds during the test. 

## Design ‚úí
All my icons and images were created with Canva, a free design tool.
